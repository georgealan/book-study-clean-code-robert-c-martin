    There are two very common reasons to pass a single argument into a function, let's see:

    // 1ยบ ASKING A QUESTION

    // 2ยบ OPERATING ON THAT ARGUMENT, TRANSFORM IT IN SOMETHING ELSE AND RETURNING IT

    // Other form less common, but still useful form is an EVENT
    void passwordAttemptFailedNtimes(int attempts) {}
    /*
    In this form there is an input argument but no output argument. The overall program is meant to interpret the
    function call as an event and use the argument to alter the state of the system.
    Use this form with care. It should be very clear to the reader that this is an event.
    Choose names and contexts carefully.

    // Try to avoid any monadic functions that don't follow these forms, for example:
    void transform1(StringBuffer out) {} // using an output argument instead of a return value for a transformation is confusing.

    StringBuffer transform2(StringBuffer in) {
        StringBuffer newSt = new StringBuffer();
        return newSt;
    }
    // If a function is going to transform its input argument, the transformation should appear as the return value.
